        The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET Web Forms pattern for creating MVC-based Web applications.
        The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that (as with Web Forms-based applications) is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages and membership-based authentication.
        The MVC framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc namespace and is a fundamental, supported part of the System.Web namespace.

        Other types of Web applications will combine the two approaches; neither approach excludes the other.
